## Description

This is a browser-based game written mainly in JavaScript and featuring rudimentary physics and enemy AI. This game was created using a tutorial and images created by Frank Dvorak. The goal of the game is to rescue a certain number of eggs and larva hatchlings from the bullies on the screen by pushing them into the woods near the top of the screen.

## Usage

Once the page loads, use your mouse to move the player character by clicking different locations on the screen, or by clicking and dragging. Eggs spawn randomly and will hatch in 5 seconds. Use the player character to push the eggs towards the treeline at the top of the screen. Hatchlings will start moving up towards the treeline, but are vulnerable to being destroyed by the bullies moving across the screen. If you rescue 30 hatchlings and eggs, you win. However, if the bullies destroy 7 hatchlings before you rescue them, you lose. Press 'R' to restart the game. Press 'D' to enter debug mode to see hit boxes, egg timer countdowns, and lost hatchlings.

## Contributing
